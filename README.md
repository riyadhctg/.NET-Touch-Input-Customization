Tapping and Swiping
=============

This was developed using .Net Framework Class library to detect touch events from a Zytronic ZYFILM flexible touch sensor (http://zytronic.co.uk/). 

The sesnor comes with a configuration tool where you can adjust properties. 

The code can detect TAP and SWIPE in three common hold positions (bottom center, bottom corner, side center) for a flexible tablet.

This code was used in a research experiment. The research outcome has been published in two separate conferences.

Disclaimer:
The code is not well organized. It could defnitely benefit from some modularity!
